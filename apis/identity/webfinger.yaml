    An ```acctUri``` contains of a local account identifier and the hostname of the system. 
    An ```acctUri``` that has a different hostname in the host-section MUST be rejected. 
    
    All user parts of ```acctUris``` are contextualised, that means that no user part links to 
    actual user accounts.

        Returns the a webfinger query response.
        
        An LMS webfinger MUST respond to acctUris. It MAY allow to verify the author of a resource.
        This could be used to verify a XAPI result URL and the actor.
        
        For authorised requests this also includes ```links``` to additional resources. 
        
        For authorised requests that are linked to the same context as the ```resource``` this will also
        include ```aliases``` that cover all alias acctUris are used in overlapping or sub-contexts.
        
        Unauthorized requests just receive the subject information.

        Adds a new ```acctUri``` to the registry. 
        
        The PowerTLA Webfinger service requires for all acctUris an account context that is a complete
        or partial XAPI Context. 
        
        This is primarily used for front-end resources that create sub-contexts for external services
        and resource providers.
